## Example 2: Stochastic growth and death model

This model includes births and deaths at per-capita rates \(r\) and \(s\) per week, respectively. The ODE for \(N\) is made up of the difference between the mean growth rate and the mean death rate:

$$ \frac{dN}{dt}=rN-sN $$

The difference \((r-s)\) is the net growth rate and the solution is either exponential growth or decline i.e.,

$$ N(t) =N(0) \exp((r-s)t) $$

If births exceed deaths (\(r > s\)) the population grows. If deaths exceed births (\(s > r\)) the population shrinks.

In the stochastic simulation, we have to be more careful as we are dealing with individuals. Each individual has a probability of reproducing and of dying in some short interval, \(dt\). However, it canâ€™t die and then give birth! These two dependent events that can happen are known as competing hazards. To calculate the number of births and deaths in a short time, we first calculate the number of births or deaths:

$$ \mbox{Births or deaths in }dt, n \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(N,(r + s)dt) $$

We then decide which were births and which deaths:

$$ \mbox{Deaths in }dt \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(s / (r + s),n) $$

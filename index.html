      <h1>Introduction to Mathematical Models of the Epidemiology & Control of Infectious Diseases 2022</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to the Imperial College London short course
        "Introduction to Mathematical Models of the Epidemiology and
        Control of Infectious Diseases"
        (<a href="http://www.infectiousdiseasemodels.org/">infectiousdiseasemodels.org</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        This course will be taught using an interface built using an R
        package called
        <code>shiny</code> using
        the <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R programming
          language</a>. Over the 8 day short course you will be using
        this interface to explore and understand the basics of
        infectious disease modelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        The links below (some links will become active as the course
        progresses) will take you to the practical and project
        materials and interface you will use over the next two weeks.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h2>Help</h2>

      <p>
        A general help file for writing model (<code>odin</code>) code
        and navigating the interface can be
        found <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/infectiousdiseasemodels-2022/guide/">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        For transitioning from this interface into R and Rstudio we
        have <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/infectiousdiseasemodels-2022/transition/">compiled a list of useful resources and a
        simple example</a> to start the transition
